                            There are times in our lives, when we think what we are doing is the right thing, <br>
                            only to find-out it's wasted time, and the wrong ladder was climbed.  <br>
                            A wise saying goes: <br>
                            in life there are no regrets only lessons. <br> 
                            Failure is a part of the journey.  <br>
                            But remember that the blazing heart rises like the phoenix,<br>
