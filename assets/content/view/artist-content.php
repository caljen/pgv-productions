                        Positively Good Vibes by Caliboy Calwayne was born, as a DIY, out of an artist's struggle to be able to create without having to depend on restrictions of producers, sample clearances, album creation, and the distribution process. Caliboy Calwayne bridged the gap between producer and artist to be able to bring his music to you, with full rights and creative control. Making ORIGINAL content and sharing the vibes to inspire higher levels.<br/><br/>

                        "My aim is to bring you danceable and innovative music, where the structure of traditional and formal arrangements are sometimes ignored, which surprisingly produce refreshing results. I am fusing the influences of Reggae, Hip Hop, Electronic Dance(EDM), and R&B. I am glad to have found music, and believe that it has the ability to promote physical health, through movement. So, basically, I want to make you dance. This is the basis on which I strive, as I share my thoughts and bring you some positively good vibes."  <br/><br/><br/>
